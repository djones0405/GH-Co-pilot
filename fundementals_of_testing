# Fundamentals of Software Testing

Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system works as intended. It is a vital part of the software development lifecycle, ensuring quality, reliability, and user satisfaction.

## 1. **What is Testing?**

Testing is executing a program with the intent of finding errors or verifying that it behaves as expected. It helps ensure that the software:
- Works correctly (meets requirements)
- Is reliable and robust
- Is maintainable and scalable

---

## 2. **Why is Testing Important?**

- **Detects Bugs Early:** Catches problems before software is released
- **Reduces Costs:** Fixing bugs earlier is cheaper than after deployment
- **Improves Quality:** Builds trust with users and stakeholders
- **Prevents Regressions:** Ensures new changes do not break existing features

---

## 3. **Types of Testing**

- **Manual Testing:** Testers execute tests by hand, following test cases or exploratory testing.
- **Automated Testing:** Tests are written as code and run automatically by tools or frameworks.

### *Common Levels of Testing:*
- **Unit Testing:** Tests individual units (functions, methods, classes) in isolation.
- **Integration Testing:** Tests interactions between multiple units or components.
- **System Testing:** Tests the complete, integrated system as a whole.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Tests the application flow from start to finish, simulating real user scenarios.
- **Acceptance Testing:** Verifies the system meets business requirements (often done by users or QA).

---

## 4. **Key Concepts**

- **Test Case:** A set of inputs, execution steps, and expected results to verify a specific behavior.
- **Test Suite:** A collection of test cases grouped together.
- **Test Runner:** A tool or framework that executes tests and reports results.
- **Assertion:** A statement in a test that checks if a condition is true (e.g., `assert a == b`).
- **Test Coverage:** A measure of how much of your code is tested.

---

## 5. **Popular Testing Frameworks**

- **Python:** `pytest`, `unittest`
- **JavaScript:** `Jest`, `Mocha`
- **Java:** `JUnit`, `TestNG`
- **Go:** `testing` package
- **C#:** `NUnit`, `xUnit`

---

## 6. **Best Practices**

- Write tests as you develop code (test-driven development is one approach)
- Keep tests independent and repeatable
- Use descriptive names for test cases
- Cover both normal and edge cases
- Review and update tests as code changes
- Run tests automatically (Continuous Integration)

---

## 7. **Common Pitfalls**

- Not writing enough tests (low coverage)
- Writing tests that are too tightly coupled to implementation details
- Not maintaining or updating tests
- Ignoring failed tests ("flaky" tests)

---

## 8. **Glossary**

- **Bug:** An error, flaw, or fault in software.
- **Regression:** A bug introduced after a code change that breaks previously working functionality.
- **Fixture:** Setup and teardown code to prepare the test environment.
- **Mock/Stub:** Fake implementations used to isolate the unit under test.

**Summary:**  
Testing is essential for building correct, reliable, and maintainable software. Understanding the basics—and making testing part of your workflow—will lead to higher quality code and fewer surprises in production.
